# Mini-Project: Cinema
A cinema in a small, isolated village wants to offer films on show to attract more young people from the surrounding villages.
To achieve this goal, the cinema managers decide to commission you to create an application allowing customers to view the available films.


# Cinema App
Description :

A web application for displaying and searching movies available online. It offers a modern and intuitive user interface for exploring films.


# Features

Display movies with images and titles.
Search for movies.
Dynamic interface built with Vite.js, which acts as an HTTP server.

# Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

# Install Vite
npm create vite@latest 

# Navigate to the project folder
cd cinema-app 

# Install npm packages
npm install 

# Start the server on a local port
npm run dev


# Using the OMDb API (The Open Movie Database)
This application uses the OMDb API to fetch movie data. To access the API, you need an API key.

# Getting an API Key
Visit the OMDb API website and sign up to obtain an API key.
You will receive your API key via email after completing the registration.


# Using the API Key in Requests
Once you have your API key, you can make requests to the OMDb API using the following structure:

=> https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[your_API_key]&s=[movie_title]

# For a movie like Transformers the request will look like that : 

https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[your_API_key]&s=transformers
